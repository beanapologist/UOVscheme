# UOVscheme Assessment

## What this project is

A **Lean 4 formal verification project** that recasts the Oil-and-Vinegar (OV) cryptographic signature scheme through a "witness/observer duality" lens. It is *not* a cryptographic implementation — there is no executable signing, verification, or key generation code. All values are `noncomputable` and the ambient type is ℝ/ℂ rather than a finite field.

## Bugs and errors

### 1. `coherence_le_one` — broken calc chain (OilVinegar.lean:113–121)

```lean
lemma coherence_le_one (r : ℝ) (hr : 0 < r) : C r ≤ 1 := by
  ...
  calc 2 * r / (1 + r ^ 2)
    ≤ (1 + r ^ 2) ^ 2 / (1 + r ^ 2) := ...   -- establishes C r ≤ 1 + r²
    _ = 1 + r ^ 2 := by field_simp
    _ ≥ 1 := by nlinarith [sq_nonneg r]        -- shows 1 + r² ≥ 1, not ≤ 1
  sorry
```

The calc chain proves `C r ≤ 1 + r²` and `1 + r² ≥ 1`, which together say nothing about `C r ≤ 1`. The direction of the last step is wrong; the chain does not compose into the goal. The `sorry` is unavoidable here as written. A direct proof works cleanly:

```lean
lemma coherence_le_one (r : ℝ) (hr : 0 < r) : C r ≤ 1 := by
  unfold C
  rw [div_le_one (by positivity)]
  nlinarith [sq_nonneg (r - 1)]
```

### 2. `public_map_embedding_T` — theorem is false as stated (UOV.lean:212–219)

The theorem claims `F η (-η) = μ`, i.e., `η + i·(-η) = μ`.

- `F η (-η) = η - i·η`, which has argument `-π/4` (fourth quadrant, angle 315°).
- `μ = e^(i·3π/4)` has argument `135°` (second quadrant).

These are different complex numbers. The correct statement would be `F (-η) η = μ` (swap signs), or alternatively define F differently. As stated, no proof exists because the claim is false. The `sorry` is hiding an incorrect theorem.

### 3. Formerly vacuous placeholders in `UOV.lean` (addressed)

Several theorems were `True := trivial` or trivial `∀ …, True`. They are now either removed or replaced with meaningful statements: `vinegar_observer_linearizes` (alias of `CentralMap.eval_as_linSystem`), `trapdoor_hardness_mq` (alias of `MQ.hard`), `public_map_is_interrogation` (definitional `rfl` for `publicEval`), and `signature_equilibrium_point` (`unified_balance`). Older internal-assessment examples that used **string-typed** pseudo-theorems referred to an earlier revision of the repo, not the current `BalanceHypothesis` / `DualityStructure` sources.

### 4. `BalanceHypothesis` hypotheses are vacuous or mistyped

```lean
hypothesis directed_balance : ∀ z : ℂ, -z.re = z.im → "Witness and observer are in opposite quadrants"
hypothesis coherence_closure : ∀ η : ℝ, "C(1 + 1/η) = η for the Silver Ratio η"
hypothesis witness_dissipation : ∀ z : ℂ, z.re < 0 → "Witness is in dissipative regime"
```

All three return string types, so they are trivially inhabited and assert nothing. `coherence_closure` also universally quantifies η over all reals — but the property only holds for η = 1/√2. The module provides no usable mathematical hypotheses.

### 5. `reality_unique` — key lemma is unproven (OilVinegar.lean:142)

This drives `signature_uniqueness` and `oil_witness_forced_by_vinegar`, the two "oil is determined" results. The proof is feasible (it reduces to a geometric argument: on the unit circle, Re < 0 and Im = -Re forces the angle to 3π/4), but requires connecting `Complex.abs` and `Complex.arg` machinery in Mathlib. Leaving it `sorry` means all downstream "uniqueness" results have no proof.

A sketch:
```lean
-- From z.re² + z.im² = 1 and -z.re = z.im:
-- substitute: z.re² + z.re² = 1 → z.re = ±1/√2
-- z.re < 0 forces z.re = -1/√2 = -η, z.im = η
-- Then z = ⟨-η, η⟩ = μ by mu_re_is_neg_eta, mu_im_is_eta and Complex.ext
```

## Conceptual gaps

### ℝ/ℂ instead of a finite field

Standard UOV (and NIST PQC variant UOV/MAYO/Rainbow variants) operates over a finite field 𝔽_q. The multivariate quadratic maps, key generation, and hardness of polynomial-system solving are all properties of finite field arithmetic. This formalization works entirely in ℝ and ℂ, which:
- Have no notion of polynomial system hardness.
- Admit transcendental functions (`exp`, `sin`, `cos`) that are meaningless in 𝔽_q.
- Do not correspond to any known OV instantiation.

The project is a mathematical structure *inspired by* OV rather than a formalization *of* OV.

### No cryptographic content

There is no:
- Key generation (sampling random polynomials in 𝔽_q[x₁…xₙ]).
- Signing (solving a linear system after fixing vinegar values).
- Verification (evaluating the public quadratic map).
- Hardness reduction (relating forgery to MQ-problem hardness).
- Hash function or message binding.

### The "trapdoor" `C(r) = 2r/(1+r²)` is not a cryptographic trapdoor

A cryptographic trapdoor is easy to compute, hard to invert without extra information, and efficiently invertible with the private key. `C` is a smooth function from ℝ to ℝ. Its inverse is explicitly computable (roots of the quadratic `r² - (2/c)r + 1 = 0`), so it offers no computational hardness. MQ-style hardness is stated separately in `MQProblem.lean` (`MQ.hard`); `UOV.lean` exposes it as `trapdoor_hardness_mq`.

## What the project does well

1. **Modular structure** — clear separation across four files with consistent namespacing.
2. **Correct proofs for the proofs that exist** — `trapdoor_bijection_forward_side`, `mu_pow_eight`, and the family of μ-properties are clean and complete.
3. **Good use of `noncomputable`** — correctly signals that no executable code is intended.
4. **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions runs `lake build`, catching regressions.
5. **The algebraic identity `C(1 + √2) = 1/√2`** — mathematically correct and the coherence closure is a genuine (if aesthetically motivated) fixed-point property.
